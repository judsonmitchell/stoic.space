[When Crates broke Zeno’s pot full of lentils in public] “Why run
away, my little Phoenician?" quoth Crates, "nothing terrible has
befallen you.”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[Zeno on losing everything and arriving in Athens] “I made a
prosperous voyage when I suffered shipwreck.”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
He used then to discourse, pacing up and down in the painted
colonnade, which is also called the colonnade or Portico … people
came henceforth to hear Zeno, and this is why they were known as
men of the Stoa, or Stoics; and the same name was given to his
followers, who had formerly been known as Zenonians.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[Athens recognition of Zeno] “Zeno of Citium, son of Mnaseas, has
for many years been devoted to philosophy in the city and has
continued to be a man of worth in all other respects, exhorting to
virtue and temperance those of the youth who come to him to be
taught, directing them to what is best, affording to all in his own
conduct a pattern for imitation in perfect consistency with his
teaching”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[Zeno] used to say that even of philosophers the greater number
were in most things unwise, while about small and casual things
they were quite ignorant.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
A Rhodian, who was handsome and rich, but nothing more, insisted
on joining his class; but so unwelcome was this pupil, that first of all
Zeno made him sit on the benches that were dusty, that he might soil
his cloak, and then he consigned him to the place where the beggars
sat, that he might rub shoulders with their rags; so at last the young
man went away. Nothing, he declared, was more unbecoming than
arrogance, especially in the young.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
To the question “Who is a friend?” [Zeno’s] answer was, “A second
self.”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
“The reason why we have two ears and only one mouth is that we
may listen the more and talk the less.” [said Zeno]
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
When Crates laid hold on him by the cloak to drag him from Stilpo,
Zeno said, “The right way to seize a philosopher, Crates, is by the
ears: persuade me then and drag me off by them; but, if you use
violence, my body will be with you, but my mind with Stilpo.”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
When he was asked why he [Zeno], though so austere, relaxed at a
drinking-party, he said, “Lupins too are bitter, but when they are
soaked become sweet.”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[Zeno] showed the utmost endurance, and the greatest frugality; the
food he used required no fire to dress, and the cloak he wore was
thin.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
He had almost become a proverb. At all events, “More temperate
than Zeno the philosopher” was a current saying about him.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
The story goes that Zeno of Citium after enduring many hardships
by reason of old age was set free, some say by ceasing to take food;
others say that once when he had tripped he beat with his hand upon
the earth and cried, “I come of my own accord; why then call me?”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Philosophic doctrine, say the Stoics, falls into three parts: one
physical, another ethical, and the third logical.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Another simile [the Stoics] use is that of an egg: the shell is Logic,
next comes the white, Ethics, and the yolk in the centre is Physics.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[the Stoics] liken Philosophy to a fertile field: Logic being the
encircling fence, Ethics the crop, Physics the soil or the trees.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Freedom from precipitancy is a knowledge when to give or withhold
the mind's assent to impressions. By wariness [the Stoics] mean a
strong presumption against what at the moment seems probable, so
as not to be taken in by it.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Without the study of dialectic, [the Stoics] say, the wise man cannot
guard himself in argument so as never to fall.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Some of our impressions are scientific, others unscientific: at all
events a statue is viewed in a totally different way by the trained eye
of a sculptor and by an ordinary man.

The notions of justice and goodness come by nature. Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,

Chrysippus affirms in the first book of his work On Ends: his words
are, “The dearest thing to every animal is its own constitution and
its consciousness thereof.”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Pleasure, if it is really felt, [the Stoics] declare to be a by-product,
which never comes until nature by itself has sought and found the
means suitable to the animal's existence or constitution

Zeno was the first (in his treatise On the Nature of Man) to
designate as the end “life in agreement with nature” (or living
agreeably to nature), which is the same as a virtuous life, virtue
being the goal towards which nature guides us.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Our individual natures are parts of the nature of the whole universe.
And this is why the end may be defined as life in accordance with
nature, or, in other words, in accordance with our own human nature
as well as that of the universe.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Virtue, in the first place, is in one sense the perfection of anything in
general, say of a statue; again, it may be non-intellectual, like health,
or intellectual, like prudence.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Amongst the virtues some are primary, some are subordinate to
these. The following are the primary: wisdom, courage, justice,
temperance.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Similarly, of vices some are primary, others subordinate: e.g. folly,
cowardice, injustice, profligacy are accounted primary … the vices
are forms of ignorance of those things whereof the corresponding
virtues are the knowledge.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
The virtues (the Stoics say) are goods of the nature at once of ends
and of means. On the one hand, in so far as they cause happiness
they are means, and on the other hand, in so far as they make it
complete, and so are themselves part of it, they are ends.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Some goods are permanent like the virtues, others transitory like joy
and walking-exercise.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Of things that are, some, [the Stoics] say, are good, some are evil,
and some neither good nor evil (that is, morally indifferent).
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
For, [the Stoics] they, such things (as life, health, and pleasure) are
not in themselves goods, but are morally indifferent, though falling
under the species or subdivision “things preferred.” … wealth and
health do no more benefit than injury, therefore neither wealth nor
health is good.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
The term “indifferent” … denotes the things which do not contribute
either to happiness or to misery, as wealth, fame, health, strength,
and the like.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Of things indifferent, as [the Stoics] express it, some are
“preferred,” others “rejected.” Such as have value, they say, are
“preferred,” while such as have negative, instead of positive, value
are “rejected.”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Things of the preferred class are those which have positive value,
e.g. amongst mental qualities, natural ability, skill, moral
improvement, and the like; among bodily qualities, life, health,
strength, good condition, soundness of organs, beauty, and so forth;
and in the sphere of external things, wealth, fame, noble birth, and
the like.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
To the class of things “rejected” belong, of mental qualities, lack of
ability, want of skill, and the like; among bodily qualities, death,
disease, weakness, being out of condition, mutilation, ugliness, and
the like; in the sphere of external things, poverty, ignominy, low
birth, and so forth.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Befitting acts are all those which reason prevails with us to do …
Unbefitting, or contrary to duty, are all acts that reason deprecates
… Acts which fall under neither of the foregoing classes are those
which reason neither urges us to do nor forbids.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[The Stoics] hold the emotions to be judgements, as is stated by
Chrysippus in his treatise On the Passions: avarice being a
supposition that money is a good, while the case is similar with
drunkenness and profligacy and all the other emotions.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
As in the body there are tendencies to certain maladies such as colds
and diarrhoea, so it is with the soul, there are tendencies like
enviousness, pitifulness, quarrelsomeness, and the like.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[The Stoics] say that the wise man is passionless, because he is not
prone to fall into such infirmity. But they add that in another sense
the term apathy is applied to the bad man, when, that is, it means
that he is callous and relentless.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[The Stoics] will take wine, but not get drunk. Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
The Stoics say that the wise man will take part in politics, if nothing
hinders him – so, for instance, Chrysippus in the first book of his
work On Various Types of Life – since thus he will restrain vice and
promote virtue.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Nor yet, [the Stoics] go on to say, will the wise man live in solitude;
for he is naturally made for society and action. He will, however,
submit to training to augment his powers of bodily endurance.

Friendship, [the Stoics] declare, exists only between the wise and
good, by reason of their likeness to one another. … No bad man has
a friend.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[The Stoics] argue that a friend is worth having for his own sake and
that it is a good thing to have many friends.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[The Stoics] hold that the virtues involve one another, and that the
possessor of one is the possessor of all, inasmuch as they have
common principles.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[The Stoics] say that justice, as well as law and right reason, exists
by nature and not by convention.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Neither do [the Stoics] think that the divergence of opinion between
philosophers is any reason for abandoning the study of philosophy,
since at that rate we should have to give up life altogether.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
[The Stoics] tell us that the wise man will for reasonable cause make
his own exit from life, on his country's behalf or for the sake of his
friends, or if he suffer intolerable pain, mutilation, or incurable
disease.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
God is one and the same with Reason, Fate, and Zeus; he is also
called by many other names.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
The term universe or cosmos is used by [the Stoics] in three senses:
(1) of God himself, the individual being whose quality is derived
from the whole of substance … (2) Again, they give the name of
cosmos to the orderly arrangement of the heavenly bodies in itself
as such; and (3) in the third place to that whole of which these two
are parts.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Now the term Nature is used by [the Stoics] to mean sometimes that
which holds the world together.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
All things happen by fate … Fate is defined as an endless chain of
causation, whereby things are, or as the reason or formula by which
the world goes on.

By matter is meant that out of which anything whatsoever is
produced.

[Cleanthes] was renowned for his industry, being indeed driven by
extreme poverty to work for a living. Thus, while by night he used
to draw water in gardens, by day he exercised himself in arguments.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
When some one twitted [Cleanthes] on his old age, his reply was, “I
too am ready to depart; but when again I consider that I am in all
points in good health and that I can still write and read, I am content
to wait.”
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Declaring that he had already got too far on the road, [Cleanthes]
went on fasting the rest of his days until his death at the same age as
Zeno according to some authorities, having spent nineteen years as
Zeno's pupil.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Hecato says that [Chrysippus] came to the study of philosophy,
because the property which he had inherited from his father had
been confiscated to the king's treasury.

“If I had followed the multitude, I should not have studied
philosophy.” (Chrysippus)

But for Chrysippus, there had been no Porch. Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
There after [Chrysippus] had taken a draught of sweet wine
unmixed with water, he was seized with dizziness and departed this
life five days afterwards, having reached the age of seventy-three
years, in the 143rd Olympiad.
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,
Book VIII
Another account is that [Chrysippus’] death was caused by a violent
fit of laughter; for after an ass had eaten up his figs, he cried out to
the old woman, "Now give the ass a drink of pure wine to wash
down the figs." And thereupon he laughed so heartily that he died.
